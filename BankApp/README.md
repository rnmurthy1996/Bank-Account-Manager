##Banking Application

#Project Introduction

Our project is a banking application that allows users to create an account from which they can deposit and withdraw money, transfer money to a different account, and view their transactions.
The project is coded in Java and utilizes the Swing API to deliver the application in an easy to use graphical user interface.
